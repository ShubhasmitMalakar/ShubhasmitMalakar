- Here are some of my new projects:
- 1. SmartPAPA: A very fun nproject that we did, where we had to build a product designer easy enough to be used by just about anyone. People can design Mugs, T-Shirts, Pillows and so on. With the integrated eCommerce system we built using server-side rendered React, they can also sell their designed products in a fast and extremely SEO friendly way, especially using their own custom domain names.

- 2. Spoken English App: Very soon to be released, this app that we are building for Govt. of Assam's Board of Secondary Education(SEBA) will consist of many stories, conversations, quizzes and Adaptive Learning Artificial Intelligence  to ensure students weak in English will master it in just a few months of using this app. We also gamified the content of this app, this making it more interesting to use.
- 3. Rock Quality Classification: An app that seems simple at first, but took quite some time to develop and calibrate was another interesting piece of tech we were priviledged to develop. Complex quality classification calculations for rocks can be calculated in seconds, and the learning curve is almost nil. A lot of features will be added soon.
